    <article>
    <h2>Preparations</h2>
        <p>
            For the preparation of this web-page, we've had to get a better understanding of the semantic tags available,
            and learn when and where to use them. The proper use of semantics in web-development in HTML is valuable not only for the developer,
            but also the end-user. For developers, semantics will help organize our code and make it easier to maintain. Web-pages can become
            large and increasingly more difficult to manage, but with a proper set of semantics, we'll be able to navigate
            throughout several lines of code while keeping our bearings intact.
            Furthermore, a proper use of semantics is important for computers as well as for humans.
            Semantic tags gives different importance weight to the tags,
            where a headline marked h1 is more important than a paragraph with the
            tag p. This increased weight allows users to locate your page with the use of keywords that matches the page's weighted tags.
        </p>

    <h2>Our structure</h2>
        <p>
        This web-page consists of four different pages:
        <ul>
            <li>Homepage</li>
            <li>CV</li>
            <li>Portfolio</li>
            <li>About</li>
        </ul>
        Each of these pages have a different purpose, and therefore are structured differently to best fulfill what they are supposed to convey
        </p>

        <h3>Homepage</h3>
        <p>
            The homepage is structured as one article containing an introduction to our individual, while providing the necessary links to navigate
            to desired web-pages connected to the individual. The purpose of the page is to give an introduction to Audun, which is why the page is
            kept short and compact, as to not give the users unnecessary information that can be found in the other more detailed pages.
        </p>
        <h3>Curriculum Vitae</h3>
        <p>
            The Curriculum Vitae page is clearly marked with headings the gives the user the information of what the page contains. This is a
            curriculum vitae that portraits Audun Bergum. The page continuous with an article that is divided by the use of several headings that
            are leveled to signify their place in the page. The different headings divides the page between the important,
            but separate categories of information. This allows the user to distinctly see the qualifications of Audun, without it becoming
            jumbled and difficult to remember. This divide makes it easier for users to look up certain aspects of Audun's qualifications that
            might be necessity when considering him for a position, such as the ability to speak a certain language.
        </p>
        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
            The portfolio is an article the displays the different accomplishments of Audun. The three components, Architecture, Art and Racing
            have their own separate headlines dividing them, with new paragraphs that contain the necessary information regarding these achievements
            These paragraphs are separated to make sure that each accomplishment is treated as its own part of information.
