    <h1> Portfolio - My feats</h1>
  <div class="Intro">  <h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p> Although I am just 19 years old, I am undoubtedly a man of many talents, therefore, this is just a brief
        introdoction to my many feats. Throughout my
        carreer, I have obtained great achievements in many different areas of work. This page will tell you a little
        about
        this.</p>

    <div class="Arcitecture">
        <h2> Arcitecture </h2>
    <p> I have worked with major arciterure companies such as Showa Sekkei and Gensler. Alongside Sn√∏hetta, I
        contributed in the design and engineering of the Oslo Opera House. </p>
    <p> As a professional in both arciterure and engineering, My skills have always been highly requested. My time in
        this field of work has given me excellent expirience within teamwork and communication. I often led teams,
        making me more expirienced as a leader as well. </p>

    <p>My work as an artist has helped me develop the creative part of my brain. I am able to see opportunities in clean
        slates that i wasnt able to see earlier. This translates well into my worklife, as I am able to use my
        creativity to always find the best and most creative solution to potential problems and projects. </p>

    <div class="Racing">
        <h2>Racing</h2>

    <p> Racing has given me valuable skills within controlling stress. I am used to working in very stressful situations
        and remain calm. This makes me able to think clear and evaluate situations and issues clearly, no matter the
        surroundings and circumstances. </p>
